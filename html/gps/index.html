<!--
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to be able to define sections more efficiently and help people with disabilities access content easier. I think the most useful ones are <header> because it gives the name for a specific document or section which is useful when looking for detailed information about something and <nav> because it gives the navigation links.

The typical order that the elements on the page are displayed by the browser are header, navigation, sidebar, main content, sidebar, footer.

In this challenge, I learned about creating snippets. I didn't know that was a possibility before or how to do it. I'm definitely going to practice making some!

I think the most difficult thing for me with this challenge as far as the material was knowing when to use each semantic element (especially compared to other basic things we've been using) and what each looks like/does. I got the basic idea, but I wish my pair and I were able to have time to use real information and take our time so that I could see what it actually looked like. I didn't get a chance to say in the beginning that I usually work on challenges slowly and thoroughly (because I'm very new to this and don't learn it well if I don't take my time) and I felt a bit rushed and pressured to understand things right away with this session which was also a challenge. I can/will improve my understanding of this by trying it out with more/real information and inspecting websites.
