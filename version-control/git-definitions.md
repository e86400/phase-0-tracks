# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
**Version control is a system that allows you to change files and all their versions and revisions and save them to be able to manage them later and keep them organized**
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
**A branch is an instruction sequence group where instructions are used to tell the CPU what to do that allows it to execute instructions in order and even change instruction sequences**
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
**A commit is a save point for instructions in Git. A good commit message is one that describes specific changes that were made.**
* What is a merge conflict?
**A merge conflict is when two are working in a version control system trying to merge changes to the same code from featured branches into the master branch, but get an error because the system doesn't know which is right or wrong and which should be retained after the merge**
